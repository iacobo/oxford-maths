Code to simulate a 'Gambler's ruin' random walk. A gambler starts with £x, and on each turn wins £y with probability p (and loses £z with probability (1-p)).

Walk ends if winnings reach given lower or upper limit.

Example detailed on p35 of the [M3 Probability](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/37524/materials) course [lecture notes](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/node/view_material/40367).
